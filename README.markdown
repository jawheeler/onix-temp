## ONIX

The ONIX standard is a somewhat verbose XML format that is rapidly becoming the
industry standard for electronic data sharing in the book and publishing
industries.

This library provides a slim layer over the format and simplifies both reading
and writing ONIX files in your ruby applications.

This replaces the obsolete rbook-onix gem that was spectacular in its crapness.
Let us never speak of it again.

## Installation

    gem install onix

## Usage

See files in the examples directory to get started quickly. For further reading
view the comments to the following classes:

* ONIX::Reader - For reading ONIX files
* ONIX::Writer - For writing ONIX files

## Licensing

This library is distributed under the terms of the MIT License. See the included file for
more detail.

## Contributing

All suggestions and patches welcome, preferably via a git repository I can pull from.
To be honest, I'm not really expecting any, this is a niche library.
